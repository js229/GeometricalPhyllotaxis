abstract = {<B>The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</B> explores mathematical models of developmental processes and structures of plants, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art computer-generated images. Plant models which grow, interact with the environment, produce flowers and fruits, and finally die, have an immense intuitive appeal of "bringing life into a computer." In front of a graphics monitor it is easy to forget the underlying mathematical formulae and simply look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors, even mutating. Without compromising the mathematical rigor of presentation the authors have tried to preserve this "touch of magic" accompanying in their research. The following areas receive particular attention: methods for the modeling and rendering of plants which are suitable for realistic image synthesis; the scientific potential of computer graphics in the visualization of biological structures and processes; the relationship between control mechanisms employed by li- ing plants and the resulting complex developmental sequences and structures; and the relationship between developmental processes, self-similarity and fractals. The formalism of L-systems are adopted as the primary mathematical vehicle used to express developmental processes. The notion of L-systems was conceived in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal model of plant development. Its exceptional elegance was promptly recognized by mathematicians, who soon developed a comprehensive theory of L-systems. However, only recently has computer graphics revealed the full potential of L-systems applied to plant modeling. Although the focus is on the original results of joint research led by the authors, a survey of alternative methods for plant modeling is also included.},

@article{turing:1952,
abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

@book{hardywright:1945,
abstract = {{This is the fifth edition of a work (first published in 1938) which has become the standard introduction to the subject. The book has grown out of lectures delivered by the authors at Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, and other universities. It is neither a systematic treatise on the theory of numbers nor a 'popular' book for non-mathematical readers. It contains short accounts of the elements of many different sides of the theory, not usually combined in a single volume; and, although it is written for mathematicians, the range of mathematical knowledge presupposed is not greater than that of an intelligent first-year student. In this edition the main changes are in the notes at the end of each chapter; Sir Edward Wright seeks to provide up-to-date references for the reader who wishes to pursue a particular topic further and to present, both in the notes and in the text, a reasonably accurate account of the present state of knowledge.}},

abstract = {Jean's `Fundamental Theorem of Phyllotaxis' (\emph{Phyllotaxis: a systematic
study in Plant Morphogenesis}, CUP 1994) describes the relationship between the
count numbers of observed spirals in cylindrical lattices and the horizontal
angle between vertically successive spots in the lattice. It is indeed
fundamental to observational studies of phyllotactic counts, and especially to
the evaluation of hypotheses about the origin of Fibonacci structure within
lattices. Unfortunately the textbook version of the theorem is incomplete in
that it is incorrect for an important special case. This paper provides a
complete statement and proof of the Theorem.},
